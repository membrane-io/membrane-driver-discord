# Discord Driver for Membrane

This [Membrane](https://membrane.io) driver allows you to interact with the Discord API through your Membrane graph.

To set up the Discord driver, follow these steps:

1. Create an [application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain the PUBLIC KEY.
   - **Optional**: Configure an interactions endpoint to receive interactions (outgoing webhooks). Use `https://<PROGRAM-ENDPOINT-URL>/interactions`.

2. Create a bot and acquire the [BOT TOKEN](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Add SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT to your bot in Privileged Gateway Intents.

3. Obtain OAuth2 [CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Configure the redirect URL in your Discord application:
     - In your Discord Developer Portal, navigate to your application's OAuth2 settings.
     - Add a Redirect URL. Use `https://<PROGRAM-ENDPOINT-URL>/callback`.

4. Invoke the `:configure` action with TOKEN, CLIENT ID, CLIENT SECRET, and PUBLIC KEY.

5. Visit the program's endpoint URL to add the bot to your server. Be sure to replace `<program's endpoint URL>` with the actual URL you configured in your application's OAuth2 settings.

To obtain the program's endpoint URL, simply right-click on the program's name and select the relevant option to copy the URL.
